- To complete this task I decided to use CRA to bootstrap an app. 
- Homepage is empty because I decided to have a menu that is available on every page of application.
- To obtain loading duration I used vanilla Performance interface as a most straightforward solution.
- To get components rendering time I used React Profiler component but it won't work in built state.
- Storing performance info: localStorage since I didn't see any need for more complex solutions.
- CSS management: css modules, to prevent any possible styles overrides.
- For some styling I used Material UI but didn't use many of it's features due to time limitations.
